# GitHub Actions Run Cleanup Script
# Deletes old workflow runs, keeping only the most recent ones OR deletes all failed runs
#
# Usage: ./cleanup-runs.sh [-y] [-f|--failed] [KEEP_COUNT]
#   -y, --yes: Skip confirmation prompt (auto-confirm deletion)
#   -f, --failed: Delete all failed runs instead of keeping recent ones
#   KEEP_COUNT: Number of runs to keep (default: 20, ignored with --failed)
#
# Examples:
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh           # Keep 20 most recent runs (with confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh -y        # Keep 20 most recent runs (no confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh 50        # Keep 50 most recent runs (with confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh -y 50     # Keep 50 most recent runs (no confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh --failed  # Delete all failed runs (with confirmation)
#   ./cleanup-runs.sh -y -f     # Delete all failed runs (no confirmation)
